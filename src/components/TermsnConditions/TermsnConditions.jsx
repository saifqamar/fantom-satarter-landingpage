          <h2>$FS Token</h2>
          <p>
            The native cryptographically-secured fungible protocol token of
            FantomStarter (ticker symbol $FS) is a transferable representation
            of attributed governance and utility functions specified in the
            protocol/code of FantomStarter, and which is designed to be used
            solely as an interoperable utility token thereon.
          </p>
          <p>
            $FS provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to
            encourage users to exert efforts towards contribution and
            participation in the ecosystem on FantomStarter, thereby creating a
            mutually beneficial system where every participant is fairly
            compensated for its efforts. $FS is an integral and indispensable
            part of FantomStarter, because without $FS, there would be no
            incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities
            or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on
            FantomStarter. Given that additional $FS will be awarded to a user
            based only on its actual usage, activity and efforts made on
            FantomStarter and/or proportionate to the frequency and volume of
            transactions, users of FantomStarter and/or holders of $FS which did
            not actively participate will not receive any $FS incentives.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to promote decentralised community governance for the
            network, $FS would allow holders to create and vote on on-chain
            governance proposals to determine future features and/or parameters
            of FantomStarter (e.g. projects overlooked by the FS team but
            well-liked by the community can be picked up through governance as
            Token & NFT holders use their voting power to champion the projects
            they believe in). For the avoidance of doubt, the right to vote is
            restricted solely to voting on features of FantomStarter; it does
            not entitle $FS holders to vote on the operation and management of
            the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of
            such assets to token holders, or select the board of directors of
            these entities, or determine the development direction of these
            entities, does not constitute any equity interest in any of these
            entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not
            intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership.
          </p>
          <p>
            $FS does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation,
            right, title, or interest in the Company, the Distributor, their
            respective affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or
            undertaking, nor will $FS entitle token holders to any promise of
            fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not
            intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant
            jurisdiction. $FS may only be utilised on FantomStarter, and
            ownership of $FS carries no rights, express or implied, other than
            the right to use $FS as a means to enable usage of and interaction
            within FantomStarter. In particular, it is highlighted that $FS:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              does not have any tangible or physical manifestation, and does not
              have any intrinsic value (nor does any person make any
              representation or give any commitment as to its value);
            </li>
            <li>
              is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its
              equivalent value in any other digital asset) or any payment
              obligation by the Company, the Distributor or any of their
              respective affiliates;
            </li>
            <li>
              does not represent or confer on the token holder any right of any
              form with respect to the Company, the Distributor (or any of their
              respective affiliates), or its revenues or assets, including
              without limitation any right to receive future dividends, revenue,
              shares, ownership right or stake, share or security, any voting,
              distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all
              forms of intellectual property or licence rights), right to

              the right to requisition or participate in shareholder meetings,
              the right to nominate a director, or other financial or legal
              rights or equivalent rights, or intellectual property rights or
              any other form of participation in or relating to FantomStarter,
              the Company, the Distributor and/or their service providers;
            </li>
            <li>
              is not intended to represent any rights under a contract for
              differences or under any other contract the purpose or pretended
              purpose of which is to secure a profit or avoid a loss;
            </li>
            <li>
              is not intended to be a representation of money (including
              electronic money), security, commodity, bond, debt instrument,
              unit in a collective investment scheme or any other kind of
              financial instrument or investment;
            </li>
            <li>
              is not a loan to the Company, the Distributor or any of their
              respective affiliates, is not intended to represent a debt owed by
              the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective
              affiliates, and there is no expectation of profit; and
            </li>
            <li>
              does not provide the token holder with any ownership or other
              interest in the Company, the Distributor or any of their
              respective affiliates.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Notwithstanding the $FS distribution, users have no economic or
            legal right over or beneficial interest in the assets of the
            Company, the Distributor, or any of their affiliates after the token
            distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading $FS does
            develop, it would be run and operated wholly independently of the
            Company, the Distributor, the distribution of $FS and FantomStarter.
            Neither the Company nor the Distributor will create such secondary
            markets nor will either entity act as an exchange for $FS.
